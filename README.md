Unlock datacenter-class intelligence on the hardware you already own — Run 290B+ frontier MoE models locally on your gaming PC at blistering interactive speeds.

## About

FreeToken is an edge-native Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) serving engine designed for running frontier-scale open-weight models on personal and consumer hardware. It treats heterogeneous edge resources—GPUs, CPUs, host memory, and interconnects—as a unified, elastic inference platform. Its core features include:  

- **Fast Edge-Native Runtime**: Provides efficient MoE serving with bandwidth-adaptive CPU–GPU co-execution ($q^\star$ policy), full-layer double-buffered prefill streaming, global LRU expert caching, graph-compatible execution, and the FTW fast weight format.  
- **Semantic-Aware Caching**: Features semantic anchor checkpoints for recurrent state and KV caches, allowing agentic context edits (e.g., tool calls, thinking blocks) to avoid redundant context recomputation.  
- **Elastic Memory Management**: Supports dynamic, runtime VRAM re-allocation between expert caches and KV memory without engine restarts or weight reloading.  
- **Broad MoE & Ecosystem Support**: Supports frontier open-weight MoE models (e.g., DeepSeek-V4-Flash, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, GLM-5.2) across various parameter scales and quantization formats (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4, FP8, BF16), with Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible APIs for seamless integration with real-world coding and tool-calling agents (e.g., Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenClaw, DeepSeek Harness). 
- **Diverse Consumer Hardware**: Scales across consumer laptops, gaming desktops, and workstation GPUs, with native support for NVIDIA RTX 30, RTX 40, and RTX 50 series GPUs.  

## Getting Started

### Desktop app

Download FreeToken for Windows or Linux at [flashml.ai](https://www.flashml.ai/). It sets the engine up for you and gives you a GUI for running models, chatting, and tuning the engine.

### CLI

Install FreeToken with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip:

```bash
uv pip install "freetoken[accel]"
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlashML-org/FreeToken.git && cd FreeToken
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[accel]"
```

## Sparse prefill expert loading (OEA)

Prefill used to stage every expert of a layer into GPU memory. With
`--prefill-oea-k0 K0` the engine stages only the experts the batch actually
activates (simplified OEA, [arXiv:2511.02237](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02237)):
each token keeps its top-`K0` experts as a baseline, additional top-k experts
already active in the batch piggyback for free, and the routing weights are
renormalized over the kept set. `K0 = top-k` is the lossless variant; smaller
`K0` trades a little quality for a smaller load. It needs an offload MoE cache
(`--moe-strategy offload`/`hybrid`) and disables the two-buffer prefill overlap
(single staging buffer).

Measured on RTX 3060 12 GB + 14 GiB host RAM, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M,
`--cpu-mem 2GiB` (4/40 layers pinned, 36 spilled), 8 GiB cgroup, greedy 32
output tokens; TTFT is the median of 2-3 runs (run-to-run spread follows the
spill files' page cache and can exceed 30%):

| Prefill staging | short prompt (16 tok) | long prompt (152 tok) | warmup |
|---|---|---|---|
| off (256/256 experts) | 14.51 s | 10.79 s | 30.9 s |
| `--prefill-oea-k0 8` (union 88/256, 202/256) | 5.37 s | 9.46 s | 7.1 s |
| `--prefill-oea-k0 4` (union 51/256, 136/256) | 3.00 s | 5.94 s | 4.9 s |

Decode throughput is unchanged (4.6-4.8 tok/s): OEA only affects prefill loading.
The three settings produce byte-identical greedy outputs for these prompts; longer
prompts saturate the union (202/256 at 152 tokens), so the lossless gain shrinks
with prompt length.
